# React + Vite

My University project inspired me to start properly learning React and the fundamentals of web dev.
This is my first major project after properly learning React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I'm using Vite as the framework instead of simply using create-react-app. I'll also be building the UI manually
instead of using Bootstrap for more granular control as well as to get a deeper understanding of React concepts.
